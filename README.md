# Complaints-registration-Online
This project aims to help the public resolve issues like streetlight repairs, water pipe leakage, rainwater drainage, and road reconstruction online, without repeatedly visiting government offices. By offering a smart web-based complaint registration and tracking system, it saves time and helps reduce corruption in public services.
